      <h1>HOW TO PREPARE FOR THE NURSING SCHOOL INTERVIEW</h1>
      <p>
          SEE ALSO: Nursing School Interview Questions and Answers The nursing school interview is the 
          all-important last step of the nursing school application process, meant to make the final determination
           of whether an applicant is a “good fit” for a nursing school program.  Many institutions turn nursing
            school interviews into a daylong affair for selected interview candidates—including campus tours, 
            information sessions, and student socials. Preparing for the nursing school interview is crucial
             because even with strong credentials, a weak interview can be the difference between getting an
              admissions offer or not. To help you succeed, I have put together my thoughts...

        Sample Answers for the Amazon Leadership Principles Interview During the Amazon interview, you should 
        absolutely expect behavioral interview questions based on Amazon's Leadership Principles.  The Amazon 
        recruiter may recommend that you prepare for the interview using the STAR method. In this article, I'll
         explain what STAR is, how to use it, and what you should do before an Amazon interview. What is the STAR
          Method? STAR is a Way to Answer Behavioral Questions The STAR method is a structured way of answering 
          behavioral interview questions. Behavioral interview questions usually start with "Tell me a time..." 
          or "Give me an example..." ...

          How to Ace the Amazon Product Manager Interview What to Expect Interviewers will probe for the following 
          areas: Negotiation & ability to influence others. Amazon PMs can take a position, convince others, and drive
           team action.  All Amazon employees challenge others and themselves, even when it may feel awkward.  During
            the interview, the interview may intentionally take the opposite side (aka devil’s advocate) to test your
             reaction. Expect questions like: Amazon recently launched display advertisements on its web page. It was

      <h1>TO PREPARE FOR THE INTERVIEW</h1>
      <p>
          To prepare for the interview, spend an hour on warm up questions such as Why Amazon? and Tell Me About Yourself.
            Spend about 4-6 hours developing stories for the drill down questions they’d ask about your previous work 
            experience. Lastly, spend 10-12 hours preparing for hypothetical questions. This may include specific 
            business problems that Amazon is encountering including pricing, supplier relationships, new market entry,
             and customer UX.

            <b>Negotiation & ability to influence others.</b> Amazon PMs can take a position, convince others, and drive
             team action.  All Amazon employees challenge others and themselves, even when it may feel awkward.
               During the interview, the interview may intentionally take the opposite side (aka devil’s advocate)
                to test your reaction. Expect questions like:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                      Amazon recently launched display advertisements on its web page. It was a very controversial
                       decision within Amazon.  Pick either the pro or con side of the argument and explain your position
                        of including ads on the site.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Assume you are the new Product Manager in our Amazon Prime business and are in charge of new 
                      Feature Development.   What data would you look at to develop to new features?  What new features would they be?

        </li>
        <li>
         <b> Dive deep, are right a lot, and think big.</b>  Amazon PMs have superior business instincts.  PMs can (and love) getting into 
            the details.  They can paint a compelling vision and articulate clearly how to achieve it. Sample questions include:
            <ul>
              <li>
                  How would you price the Kindle Fire HD?
              </li>
              <li>
                  Assume you are the new Product Manager in our Amazon Prime business and are in charge of Pricing.   
                  The VP would like to lower the price from $79.99 per year to $69.99 per year.  Making your own 
                  assumptions, develop the financial projections of this decision.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Start a new category, division, or international market for Amazon.  Which one did you choose and why?

           <b> Deliver results.</b>  Amazon PMs focus on the right issues.  No obstacle is too large for PMs to hurdle.  
            PMs always deliver.  Expect behavioral interview questions such as Give me an example of a situation 
            where you had to overcome major obstacles to achieve your objectives.
        </li>
        <li>
           <b> Innovate & simplify.</b>  Amazon PMs are resolute in improving products and processes.  They are highly
             aware of new trends & new opportunities.  Expect questions such as Tell me about the last time you 
             had an idea to improve the way things work. Was this idea implemented?  Why or why not?
